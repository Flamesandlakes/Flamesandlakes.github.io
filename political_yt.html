  <h1  id="data">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      2024 was an election year in the United States of America - the world's second largest democracy. Political discourse is arguably central to democratic societies. And in the age of digital media, it is hard to understate the role that online content plays in political discourse. 
      <br><br>
      There are many facets of online political discourse. I will be focusing on political commentators on Youtube. Though depending on the definition, they may also be considered to be online influencers. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The data used in this project is collected from Youtube channels representating various left- and right-leaning political commentators.</a>. 
      It covers <b>12795</b> individual videos with their corresponding transcripts. The total runtime of these videos are <b>4868.3</b> hours, which translates to more than 202 days worth of watch time.
      The data is sourced from a selection of 10 Youtube channels with 9 corresponding political commentators as a pair of channels belong to the same commentator. As such, this project is closer to representating a snapshot than the full picture of the online political discourse, despite the aforementioned quantity of data.  
      I will primarily focus on the contents of these video transcripts. I am aware that some of these transcripts may be based on auto-generated subtitles, which may be prone to occassional misannotations. 
      I am assuming that these are minor in the grand scheme of things. But I will also later validate sampled transcripts to evaluate the validity of these transcripts.  
      
    </p>
    <p>
      The data includes videos published on their respective channels, in the time window spanning from the 1st of June 2024 to the 18th of March 2025.
      <br>
      Additional variables on each video include the video title (at the time of data collection), the channel that posted it, the length of the video, when it was published alongside a couple of other variables.
      <br> 
    </p>
      
    </p>
    <p>

<div class="w3-content w3-padding-large w3-margin-top" >
  <h2 id="wordFrequencies">What do they say?</h2>

  <p>
    That is central to what I want to know. Though I am equally interested in partisan divides, i.e. whether the content of videos differ based on the political leaning of the creator.
    A qualitative approach may be considered if not for the scale of the data. This is to the benefit of quantitative textual analysis, which may reveal insights that otherwise would be infeasible to uncover. 
    <br><br>
    The most straightforward strategy to begin with is counting words. Not manually, of course.
    <br>
    It is noted that super common words, that are otherwise present to pad out or structure sentences, are left out (or at least are supposed to be in theory ...). 
    These words are called stopwords and they include words such as "is", "are", "not", "he", "she", "it", "you", "me" etc.
    <br> Additionally, all words are processed as lowercase including names and acronyms.
    <br><br>
  </p>
    Now, the ten most frequent words across the 12795 videos are:<br>
    
    <ol>
      <li><b>like</b> - 209229 times.</li>
      <li><b>uh</b> - 162406 times.</li>
      <li><b>know</b> - 161583 times.</li>
      <li><b>people</b> - 130855 times.</li>
      <li><b>going</b> - 127803 times.</li>
      <li><b>trump</b> - 116439 times.</li>
      <li><b>thats</b> -  116390 times.</li>
      <li><b>dont</b> -  108821 times.</li>
      <li><b>right</b> - 97551 times.</li>
      <li><b>think</b> - 95087 times.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
    Well, uh, it seems like I have not accounted for interjections such as "uh", which arguably is not meaningful on its own. 
    Though to play devil's advocate, that applies to most words without a surrounding sentence.
    [These cases might be left out in later topical analysis, where interjections does not relate nor convey the topic at hand.]
    </p>
    <p>
    As it pertains to potential partisan differences, 
    the respective top ten words for left-leaning and right-leaning commentators are very similar. 
    The definition of common words is still somewhat loose, as there is definitely an argument to be made, 
    that some of these words are still filler words. 
    I would consider "uh","thats", "dont" and "going" as examples of such. 
    The case is less clear regarding the other words. The one word I would certainly not consider to be filler is "trump" (or "Trump").
    </p>
    <p>
      The two top ten lists does not aid in discerning how the two political grouping differ from each other.
    </p>

    <!-- [[NOTE: What is the word count per video per leaning?]] -->
    <br><br>
    
  <div style="display: inline-block">
    Words counts among left-leaning channels

    <li><b>right</b> - 52269 times.</li>
  </ol>
</div> 
<p>
  Now, the insight provided by this comparison between two lists of 10 words each is limted, to be frank.
  Besides being able to tell that Trump is key figure to both political leanings, 
  it does not tell us much about the bigger picture.
</p>
<p>
  What if we quantify the differences between these lists instead? 
  For any given number - with that number how many words from the top we list - I can count how many words appear in one list but not in the other. 
  Let us look at the first three comparisons as an example. 
  The first comparison is between the top 1 word of each leaning. 
  That is "like" in the case of both lists. The difference is zero.
  <br>
  The second comparison is between the top 2 words of each leaning.
  That is "like" and "know" in comparison to "like" and "uh". 
  "uh" is not in the first list, while "know" does not appear in the second list. 
  It does not matter from which list we reference, as in either case the difference is one word. 
  <br>
  For the third pair of lists, "like", "know" and "uh" is compared to "like", "uh" and "know". 
  As we ignore the order in which the words appear, the words of the two lists are identical to each other.
  The difference is once again zero.
</p>
<p>
  Each step introduces two words, resulting in one of four outcomes. <br>
  <ol>
  <li>The words are different to each other and does not appear on the other existing list of words. The difference is increased by one.</li>
  <li>Each word are identical to each other. The existing difference neither increases nor decreases.</li>
  <li>Each word are different, but they have each previously been listed on the other list. The difference is decreased by one.</li>
  <li>Each word are different, but one is already listed on the other list, while the inverse does not apply to the second word. The existing difference neither increases nor decreases. 
    This outcome may be thought of a combination of the first and third outcome, but spread out between a prior pair and the current pair of words.</li>
</ul>
  <br><br>
  We can visualise this progression in number of differences through a bar plot.   
</p>
<img src="images/political_yt/set difference_among top words_left vs right_default stopwords removed_first 10.png">
<p>
  Once the entire respective top 10 lists are compared to each other, there are no differences in terms of the words contained one list but not in the other. 
  <br><br>
  Now, what happens when we observe the first 100 lists. 
  Though remember that the further down the list we go, the less frequent these words will be compared to the prior steps. 
  There will theoretically be a point at which a difference in observed frequency is marginal. 
  This is something I will delve into later, but for now, the top lists of the smaller sizes are more generally worthy of note (though unless stopwords are present) until we reach a (yet to be determined) point.
  The top third most common word will simply gnerally play a much more central role in the content than the 117th most common word.    
</p>
<img src="images/political_yt/set difference_among top words_left vs right_default stopwords removed_first 100.png">
<p>
  While the third outcome also occurs after this point, the other outcomes are more common, specically the first outcome.
  The top 10 lists are revealed to be quite rare, if not unique, in this bigger range of list sizes.  
  All comparisons between top lists beyond the 10th have atleast one difference, with a tendency to increase more than decline. 
  That said, there are a least of couple sequential sizes, where the number of differences is unchanged.
  <br>
  After 100 comparisons, there are 8 words that are unique to their respective list. 
  That means that they share the other 92 words.  
  As for the words that make up the difference, they are:

<!-- INSERT table with 10 rows (incl one for header and one for subdivisions) and 2 or 3 columns -->
<br><br>
<p>
  So far, the increase in difference suggests that the vocabulary of each side is distinct. 
  Though approaching linguistic differences based on top lists is inherently limited and even potenially misleading. 
  The rate of increase (or decrease) can never surpass 1 per step. 
  Likewise, the plot might give the illusion of a steady climb, though the possible difference is capped by the size of the top lists that are being compared.

<h2 id="sentimentOverTime">What are their sentiments?</h2>
Sentiments describes what kind of emotion is expressed based on the language used. 
In this case, I am applying the NLTK Sentiment Intensity Analyzer to the sentence of each video transcript and find their compounded sentiment. 
As noted, this is based on intensity ranging from negative, to neutral, and to positve. 
This may be considered a bit black-and-white (and a bit of grey), as I am unable to discern whether a negative sentiment is due to anger, fear or a different negative emotion.

    At no point does the average sentiment cross into the negative values. There are a couple of peaks and downward turns, and them seem to be less stable after early August (Week 32) of 2024.

<div class="w3-content w3-padding-large w3-margin-top">
  <h2 id="dialogueUMAP">How similar are the videos to each other?</h2>
  <p>
  In order to determine how similar videos are to each other, I need a way to compare videos, specifically their transcripts. 
  In this case, I am using TF-IDF, which basically meaure the importance of each word in a video relative to its overall occurence across all video transcripts.  
  If a word is observed multiple times within a particular transcript, while the word otherwise is not common among the other transcripts, then the word is measured to have a higher importance to the particular transcript. 
  These measures are then vectorized and then reduced to two dimensions to allow for 2D visualisation. 
  This last step involves UMAP, which is a dimensionality reduction technique that conserves the neighborhoods of each data point 
  - that is the videos that are similar to each other in regards to the words that important to them.
  </p>
  <p>
  I emphasize that the values associated with a video's coordinates within the UMAP representation carry no meaning outside of context. What matters is what other videos are closer to it, i.e. the videos that it form a cluster or "neighbourhood" with. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Clustering techniques may be employed to extract these clusters. But first, I want to interpret and infer the characteristics of clusters visually through additional variables. This include the time for when the videos were published, their sentiment, the leaning of their respective channels among other factors.
  </p>
</div>
<!-- 
So,

<div class="w3-content w3-padding-large w3-margin-top">
<p>
  Let us first look at the structure of the data points, each representating a video transcript. In this regard, there is a global structure as well as multiple local structures. 
  Foremost, there is a central cluster with minimal spaced seperation, potentially consisting of multiple subclusters depending on how granular our definition is. 
  This center is surrounded my chained, or "snake-like", clusters. 
  Does this mean that these videos in the clustered in the center likewise are central to the political discourse? 
  No, it simply indicates their close proximity to each other relative to all other videos.  
  The contrast to note lies in that multiple videos are closer to each other, where as the videos in the chains have neighbouring videos that are similar but are further from their neighbours. 
  This may point to some sequentiel order in which the content of the videos gradually shifts. 
</p>

  <p>
The color gradient represents the time of publishing counted in the number of days since June 1st (the start of the time window from which the data has been collected from). 
For reference, the number of days from June 1st to November 5th (Election Day) is 157 days. 
</p>
<p>
It is possible to visually interpret a temporal divide, which 
 - based on the gradient change - is before and after the Election. 
 This also supports the notion that the chained clusters represents a gradual shift, specifically occuring over time. 
 That said, the divide is not a clear break nor do clusters necessarily only consist of videos that are temporally adjacent.

In extension of the timelines plotted earlier, we already know that the average video holds a positive sentiment.

Behind the scenes I am working on finding and adjusting a color scheme, where the color of the negative cases more clear stand out among the majority of positive cases.

<p>
The chain-shaped clusters belong for the most part to a specific leaning. 
This could suggest a partisan difference in what topics they cover, or in the very least the words and language, between each side. 
However there are some intersections, not to mention the center, where videos from each leaning are mixed among each other. Even so, it is noteworthy how most of the clusters are relatively seperated on the basis of political leaning.
